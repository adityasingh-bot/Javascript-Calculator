 It is simple project to practice JavaScript functionalities using HTML and CSS with simple UI having a custom textbox which is disabled and used as screen for calculator and have normal html buttons that's used to create number from 0 to 9 and all basic four calculation expressions(Division, Multiplication, Subtraction and Addition).

 It’s good practice, because I’ll train myself to think like a developer and mathematical problem solving using JavaScript help me to understand different methods calls and function implementations.
